## 🛡️ The `.gitignore` Essentials

When building apps, you don't want to push heavy or sensitive files to GitHub. A `.gitignore` file tells Git exactly what to ignore.

```bash
# Add these to your .gitignore file so they never get pushed:
node_modules/
.env

```

Would you like me to draft the `DAY1-NOTES.md` file with the answers to yesterday's quiz, or should we go ahead and format the README for Day 3?
