## 📅 WEEK 1 — Tools, AI & Developer Mindset (Days 1-7)
**Goal:** Before writing one line of web code, you'll already work like a modern developer. These tools cut your learning time in half AND are sellable skills on their own from Day 7.

### 🔧 DAY 1 — Git & GitHub
* **Why:** Every client project, portfolio piece, and collaboration runs through Git. No exceptions.
* **Resource:** Git and GitHub for Beginners – Crash Course (freeCodeCamp) on YouTube.
* **Tasks:** Install Git, create a GitHub account, and create a repo called "my-30-day-journey".
* **Tasks:** Make 3 commits and push it live to GitHub.
* **Proof of Work:** Public GitHub repo link with 3+ commits.
* **Quiz:** Answer the differences between git add/commit, the purpose of git push origin main, and branching in a DAY1-NOTES.md file.

### 🌐 DAY 2 — GitHub Advanced + Deployment Basics
* **Why:** Clients want to see live projects, not local files. Deployment is a must-have skill.
* **Tasks:** Learn Pull Requests, Issues, and Markdown, then write a proper README.md for your Day 1 repo.
* **Tasks:** Deploy a simple HTML page live via GitHub Pages or Vercel and understand .gitignore.
* **Proof of Work:** A live URL you can share with anyone.

### 🤖 DAY 3 — AI Coding Tools
* **Why:** These tools will cut your learning AND delivery time in half, so master them.
* **Tasks:** Install Cursor, connect it to projects, and have it generate code from an HTML task.
* **Tasks:** Use v0.dev to generate a landing page UI, and practice prompting ChatGPT/Claude to explain errors.
* **Proof of Work:** Screenshot of AI-generated UI from v0.dev + your error-solving prompt.

### ⚙️ DAY 4 — n8n Automation
* **Why:** n8n automation is a legitimate $500-$2k/month service. Knowing it now gives you an income stream while you learn web dev.
* **Tasks:** Sign up at n8n.io and build Workflows for Gmail to Google Sheets and Form submission to Slack/Discord.
* **Proof of Work:** Screenshot of a working 2+ node n8n workflow.

### 🎨 DAY 5 & 🎬 DAY 6 — AI Generation
* **Day 5 Tasks:** Sign up for Leonardo.ai, generate 5 hero section images using a specific prompt formula, and generate a logo concept.
* **Day 6 Tasks:** Generate a 5-second AI video clip using Runway or Kling, create an AI voiceover via ElevenLabs, and combine them in Canva.
* **Proof of Work:** 5 generated images, prompt formulas, 1 AI video clip, and 1 AI voiceover saved.

### 🏁 DAY 7 — Week 1 Integration Project
* **Project:** Build a 1-page AI Tools Portfolio Site showing who you are, what tools you know, and sample outputs. Deploy it live.
* **Tasks:** Build in HTML/CSS, deploy via GitHub Pages, push all Week 1 work to GitHub, and write a DAY7-REFLECTION.md.
* **Proof of Work:** Live deployed page + organized GitHub repo with 7+ days of commits.
